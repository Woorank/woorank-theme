## A collection of reusable styles and components

### Atomic Design

This style guide is built on a nuclear way of thinking. The **Structures** are made of **Patterns** which are composed of **Components**. **Icons**, **Typography** and **Colors** are standalone sub-components.

---

### Based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 3.3.7.

Use the HTML from Bootstrap website or the tags given by the component description in your code. All **Bootstrap** elements and a lot of new elements are available in this library.

---

### How to use ?

Insert the minified CSS file on your app. See on the top right corner to download or get the source URL. If you want to use icons, download the SVG symbols file and insert it at the beginning of the body element of your page.
